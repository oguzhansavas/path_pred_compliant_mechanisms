# Path Prediction of Compliant Mechanisms
Optimization of path-generating compliant mechanisms, part of an ongoing master's thesis, still being worked upon and not fully functional. Uploaded here for backup 
purposes for now. Contributions by Oguzhan Savas and Lars Muschalski from ILK of TU Dresden.

By utilizing optimization methods (i.e. Genetic Algorithms),compliant mechanisms can be designed to follow a user defined target path, but this optimization procedure 
takes a long time. So, there are still restrictions in terms of repetitive designing of target paths. The focus of this project is to improve the optimization procedure 
by implementing a Deep Learning model.

Examples of path prediction:
